# Baby-Steps
The beginning of something quite exciting and energizing 

This is my version of a GitHub intro - it seems like I'm jumping into this world with open arms, ready absorb all these juicy Data Science and Python concepts like a slick sponge! 

Aiming for this experience to be a sustainable one, and to hopefully support my dreams in the future as well. 

Signing off, 
Sam
